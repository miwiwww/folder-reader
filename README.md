Real-Time Folder-Based Media Playback for AV Programs via Syphon Output

This project enables real-time playback of images and videos from a designated folder in an AV (Audio-Visual) program via Syphon Output. 
It continuously monitors the folder, allowing media files to be dynamically updated, making it ideal for live performances or installations. 
Add or remove files in the folder during playback, and the program automatically integrates new media in real-time without requiring a restart.

Features

Syphon Integration: Streams media directly to AV software like Resolume Arena / MadMapper.
Real-Time Folder Monitoring: Continuously updates playback content as media files are added or removed.
Original Resolution Display: Maintains each image or videoâ€™s original resolution and aspect ratio for optimal quality.
Configurable Playback Duration: Set the display time for each media item.

Requirements

Processing: Required for visual output and media handling.
Syphon Library: Required to output visuals to Syphon-compatible software.
Usage
Video Library: Required to read video files.

Place images and videos in the specified folder.
Run the script, and the program will loop through all files in the folder, streaming them to the Syphon client in real-time.
